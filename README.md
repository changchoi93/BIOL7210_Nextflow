This Nextflow repository is for an assignment for the BIOL7210 class. It contains a Nextflow script that takes two paired end read .fastq files as an input, does FastQ read trimming as the first step, and then FastA assembling as the second step. Because Github only allows 100MB files, I had to upload the .fastq files as compressed in .gz format. Please decompress before running the Nextflow script as the Nextflow script expects .fastq extension.
